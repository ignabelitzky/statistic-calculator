# Statistics Calculator
Statistics calculator. It performs the following operation:
* Arithmetic Mean
* Median
* Minimum
* Maximum
* Variance
* Standard Deviation (n-1)
* Lower Quartile (in development)
* Upper Quartile (in development)

## Getting Started
To compile the Static Calculator you should open the CMakeList.txt file with QT Creator and now you can build the app and run on your Linux machine.

### Input/Output of the data/calculations
The data can be entered manually or via a space-separated numbers file.
The calculations are very easy to show, just select what you want to see and press "Display selected data".

### TO-DO
- The posibility of see all the data and do modifications.
- Implement the possibility of show data on a graphic.
- Implement lower and upper quartile.
- Improve GUI with a background and some colours (remainder: make the interface more modern).

### Known issues
- It is not a modular code.
- The load of data it's not perfect (i.e it does not check if you type letters or if the format of the input file is correct)
- The "Show Graphic" button must be implemented.
